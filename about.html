									<h1>What Are Liminal Spaces?</h1>
									<p>Liminal spaces are the 'in-between' places that are typically transitionary or transformative. 
										<br> They are the spaces that feel both familiar and strange, often evoking a sense of eeriness and nostalgia.</p>

								<p>Liminal spaces are spaces of transition or transformation that exist between the familiar and the unknown, the past and the future, or different states of being. These spaces often evoke a sense of ambiguity, discomfort, or unease due to their intermediate nature. They can be physical locations, like abandoned buildings, empty hallways, or deserted playgrounds, as well as metaphorical spaces representing phases of life transitions, such as adolescence or periods of uncertainty.</p>
								<h3>Understanding the Meaning of "Liminal"</h3>
								<p>The term "liminal" is derived from the Latin word "limen," meaning "threshold." It refers to the quality of being on the boundary or threshold between two distinct states, conditions, or phases. In anthropology and psychology, the concept of liminality is used to describe the intermediate phase of a rite of passage, where individuals are no longer in their previous state but have not yet reached the next stage. This phase is often characterized by ambiguity, openness, and potential for change.</p>
								<h3>Key Characteristics of Liminal Spaces</h3>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Transitional Nature:</strong> Liminal spaces exist between two distinct areas or states, serving as a passage from one to the other.</li>
									<li><strong>Ambiguity:</strong> These spaces often lack clear definition and can be unsettling or disorienting because they do not fit neatly into a category.</li>
									<li><strong>Unsettling or Strange Atmosphere:</strong> The strangeness and emptiness of liminal spaces can evoke feelings of discomfort or unease.</li>
									<li><strong>Potential for Transformation:</strong> Liminal spaces symbolize potential and possibility, as they are points of transition where change can occur.</li>
									<li><strong>Temporal Aspect:</strong> They can represent moments in time where individuals or groups are in a state of flux, such as the period between leaving one job and starting another.</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>How Liminal Spaces Make Us Feel</h3>
								<p>Liminal spaces often evoke a range of emotions, from nostalgia to unease. They remind us of places we've been but cannot quite place, and they challenge our perception of space and time. We encourage you to explore these spaces, capture their essence through photography, and share your experiences.</p>
